## Self-hosting

```
$ sudo -u postgres psql
create database cm;
\c cm
create extension pg_trgm;
^D
$ psql cm -f cautious_memory/sql/schema.sql
$ psql cm -f cautious_memory/sql/functions.sql
```

Copy config.example.json5 to config.json5 and edit appropriately. Make a virtualenv for the bot,
and `pip install -e .`. Then just `python -m cautious_memory`.

### Migrations

`pip install migra`, then `migra postgresql://your-production-connection-string postgresql://your-local-connection-string --unsafe`.
Review the changes, and execute them against prod. For me this usually looks like:

```
$ dropdb cm; createdb cm
$ psql -f sql/schema.sql
$ psql -f sql/functions.sql
$ ssh -NfL 5433:localhost:5432 bots@myserver
$ migra postgresql://bots:password@localhost:5433/cm postgresql:///cm --unsafe > migrate.sql
$ edit migrate.sql  # as necessary
$ psql postgresql://bots:password@localhost:5433/cm -f migrate.sql
$ rm migrate.sql
```
